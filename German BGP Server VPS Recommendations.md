sysctl -p
```

2. TCP Optimization
```bash
cat >> /etc/sysctl.conf << EOF
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 1200
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10000 65000
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192
net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 5000
EOF
sysctl -p
```

### Security Hardening
1. Change SSH Port
2. Enable Firewall
3. Regular System Updates
4. Configure fail2ban

## 📝 Important Notes

## 🌐 DNS Configuration Guide

### Recommended DNS Servers
```bash
# German Region Recommended DNS
nameserver 154.83.83.90  # German Dedicated DNS, supports Netflix/Disney+ and other streaming services
nameserver 154.83.83.83  # Global Default DNS, good compatibility
```

### DNS Configuration Steps
1. Backup current DNS configuration:
```bash
cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bak
```

2. Set new DNS:
```bash
echo "nameserver 154.83.83.90" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

### DNS Usage Tips
